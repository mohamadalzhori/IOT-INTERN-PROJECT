* Project Presentation

### Project Description:
• Successfully developed an IoT-based Home Automation system using Arduino Uno board, PICSimLab, and Blynk application.
• Implemented automatic control of temperature, lighting, and fluid levels based on sensor readings for efficient energy management.
• Integrated remote control functionality through a mobile application, allowing users to monitor and adjust the home automation system from anywhere.
• Fully simulated the project on PICSimLab software for comprehensive testing and validation of the system's functionality.
